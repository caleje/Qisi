# Qisi

Qisi - Mandarin, pronounced approximately "cheese-suh", meaning "cheese".  This is a little project to explore cross-language homophones, especially puns.  I was inspired to do this when, while learning Mandarin along with my kids, I noticed that the Mandarin word for "head" is pronounced like "toe".
